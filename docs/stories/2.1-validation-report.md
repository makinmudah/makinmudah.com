**Quality:** Dev Agent has complete testing guidance without needing external docs.

---

### ✅ Security Considerations

**Status:** PASS

Security requirements appropriate for this feature:

**Applicable Security Measures:**
- ✅ XSS Protection: Vue's automatic HTML escaping (mentioned in context)
- ✅ URL Encoding: Query parameters use `encodeURIComponent()` (Task 3)
- ✅ Content Security Policy: Referenced in architecture (server/middleware/security-headers.ts)
- ✅ HTTPS: Enforced by hosting platform (Technical Constraints section)

**Not Applicable (Read-Only Display Page):**
- N/A CSRF: No forms or state-changing operations
- N/A SQL Injection: No database queries, static mock data
- N/A Authentication: Public page, no auth required
- N/A Input Validation: No user input on this page

**Risk Assessment:**
- Risk Level: **Low** (static content display)
- No sensitive data handling
- No authentication or authorization required
- Query parameters properly encoded

---

### ⚠️ Task Sequence Validation

**Status:** SHOULD-FIX (Non-Blocking)

**Current Sequence:**
1. Task 1: Create page
2. Task 2: Define data models
3. Task 3: Create CatalogueCard component
4. Task 4: Create CatalogueGrid component
5. Task 5: Integrate components
6. Task 6-7: Unit tests
7. Task 8: E2E tests
8. Task 9: Update landing CTAs
9. Task 10-11: Verification

**Issue:**
Top-down approach (page first, then components) might require Dev Agent to create placeholder components first or refactor during implementation.

**Recommended Sequence (from Dev Notes):**
1. Task 2: Define data models (foundation)
2. Task 3: Create CatalogueCard.vue (smallest unit)
3. Task 6: Unit tests for CatalogueCard (test as you build)
4. Task 4: Create CatalogueGrid.vue (composes cards)
5. Task 7: Unit tests for CatalogueGrid
6. Task 1: Create page (composes everything)
7. Task 5: Integrate components
8. Task 9: Update landing CTAs
9. Task 8: E2E tests
10. Task 10-11: Verification

**Assessment:**
- **Severity:** Low (SHOULD-FIX, not CRITICAL)
- **Impact:** Dev Agent may need to reorder tasks or create stubs
- **Mitigation:** Dev Notes section "Implementation Recommendations" suggests bottom-up approach
- **Blocker?** No - Story is still implementable with current sequence

## Recommendations

### For Dev Agent (Implementation Phase)

1. **Consider reordering tasks** to follow bottom-up approach:
   - Start with Task 2 (data models)
   - Build CatalogueCard.vue with its tests
   - Build CatalogueGrid.vue with its tests
   - Compose page
   - Integration and E2E tests last

2. **Leverage existing code:**
   - Copy data structure from `pages/katalog.vue`
   - Extract card styling from existing catalogue page
   - Reuse `<CommonAppFooter />` component

3. **Test as you build:**
   - Write unit tests immediately after creating each component
   - Run tests frequently to catch issues early

### For Product Owner (Story Review)

**No action required.** Story is ready for implementation.

### For Scrum Master (Workflow)

**Approve story for implementation.** Change status from "Draft" to "Ready" once PO review is complete.
