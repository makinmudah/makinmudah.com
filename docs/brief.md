# Project Brief: Makin Mudah Landing Page

---

## Executive Summary

**Makin Mudah Landing Page** is a Nuxt-based, SEO-optimized marketing website designed to drive conversions for Makin Mudah's IT products and consulting/mentoring services. The landing page serves two distinct but complementary audiences through a unified experience: small business owners seeking simple, affordable IT solutions without installation requirements, and students looking for accessible IT learning with mentor support.

**Why Now:** The COVID-19 digital acceleration has created urgent demand for IT solutions across Indonesia, but non-technical users remain underserved and intimidated. As businesses digitize to survive and students seek future-proof skills, the gap between complex IT offerings and user capability has never been wider. This is the critical window to establish Makin Mudah as the accessible, trustworthy IT partner for everyday Indonesians.

**The Problem:** Non-technical Indonesian users face a paralyzing barrier when seeking IT solutions—existing providers overwhelm with technical jargon, lock customers into expensive long-term contracts, and offer no hand-holding for beginners. This creates fear, hesitation, and ultimately inaction, leaving potential users stuck with manual processes or inadequate tools.

**Target Market:**

- Primary: Indonesian small business owners (retail, services, SMEs) with zero IT expertise
- Secondary: Indonesian students (university/college level) seeking IT skills and career preparation

**The Solution Approach:** A web-based landing page that immediately demonstrates value through free, accessible tools or assessments, proving simplicity before asking for commitment. Users self-select their journey (business applications or learning/mentoring) while experiencing unified brand values: transparency, affordability, and continuous support.

**Key Value Proposition:** "Hidup makin mudah dengan Makin Mudah" - Simple, web-based IT solutions and mentoring with transparent, flexible pricing ("Bayar Seperlumu, Bayar Semaumu"), no lock-in contracts, and mentor-supported learning that ensures users never struggle alone.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

**For Small Business Owners:**

Indonesian small and medium businesses are caught in a digital divide crisis. They recognize the need for IT solutions—inventory management, customer databases, online presence, point-of-sale systems—but face a paralyzing combination of obstacles:

- **Complexity Intimidation:** Existing IT solutions assume technical literacy. Documentation, setup processes, and user interfaces use jargon that alienates non-technical owners. A restaurant owner or retail shop manager doesn't know what "API," "cloud deployment," or "SaaS" means, yet these terms dominate marketing materials.

- **Contract Fear:** Software vendors lock customers into 12-24 month contracts with punitive cancellation terms. For small businesses operating on thin margins with uncertain futures (especially post-pandemic), this commitment feels like financial quicksand.

- **Installation Barriers:** Traditional software requires dedicated IT staff or expensive consultants for installation, configuration, and maintenance. Small businesses can't afford a "tech person," leaving them dependent on vendors who may be unresponsive or exploitative.

- **Hidden Costs:** Advertised pricing rarely reflects total cost. Setup fees, per-user charges, storage limits, support tiers, and upgrade costs create budget uncertainty and distrust.

**For Students:**

Indonesian students face a different but equally frustrating challenge in IT education:

- **Tutorial Overload, Zero Guidance:** The internet offers countless free tutorials, but students drown in options without knowing where to start, what's credible, or how to progress systematically. Self-learning becomes overwhelming and discouraging.

- **Affordable Mentorship Gap:** Premium bootcamps and courses (Rp 5-20 million) are financially out of reach for most students. Free resources lack the personalized guidance, accountability, and career advice that mentors provide.

- **Isolation and Dropout:** Learning technical skills alone leads to high dropout rates. When students hit roadblocks (bugs, concepts they can't grasp, motivation dips), they have no support system and abandon their learning journey.

- **Non-Technical Background Stigma:** Students from non-CS backgrounds (business, humanities, sciences) feel excluded from IT opportunities because learning resources assume prior programming knowledge or use intimidating language.

### Impact of the Problem

**Quantifiable Business Impact:**

- Indonesia has 64+ million MSMEs (Micro, Small, Medium Enterprises), with only ~13% digitally integrated (Ministry of Cooperatives data, 2021)
- Lost productivity and revenue opportunities due to manual processes
- Competitive disadvantage against digitized competitors
- Barriers to e-commerce participation (market growing 20%+ annually)

**Quantifiable Student Impact:**

- Indonesia's digital talent gap estimated at 600,000 workers (2022 reports)
- Unemployment among fresh graduates while tech jobs go unfilled
- Income opportunity loss (IT roles pay 2-3x traditional entry positions)
- Career mobility limitations for non-CS graduates wanting tech transitions

**Emotional/Social Impact:**

- Business owners feel "left behind" by digital transformation, experiencing shame and anxiety
- Students feel inadequate and excluded from lucrative tech careers
- Communities miss out on innovation that could solve local problems

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Current IT Service Providers:**

- Target enterprise customers with complex offerings inappropriate for SMEs
- Use English-dominant interfaces and support (language barrier)
- Prioritize features over simplicity, creating bloated products
- Lack empathy for non-technical users' mental models

**Existing Learning Platforms:**

- Western-centric content (examples, case studies, pricing in USD)
- Assume always-available mentorship isn't needed (self-directed learning bias)
- Community forums in English or too large to provide personalized help
- No bridge between learning and local Indonesian job market

### Urgency and Importance Now

**Digital Acceleration is Non-Reversible:** COVID-19 permanently shifted consumer behavior online. Businesses that don't digitize face extinction, not just disadvantage. The window to capture this transitioning market is now—before international competitors or established players simplify their offerings.

**Demographic Opportunity:** Indonesia's young, mobile-first population (median age 29) represents a massive addressable market entering peak earning/spending years. Students making career decisions today will influence their networks for decades.

**Competitive Vacuum:** No established Indonesian brand has successfully positioned itself as "IT for everyone" with both products AND education. First-mover advantage exists for building trust and community in this underserved segment.

**Government Support Aligned:** Indonesian government initiatives (Making Indonesia 4.0, digital economy push) create favorable environment, potential partnerships, and user readiness/awareness.

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach

The **Makin Mudah Landing Page** solves the accessibility barrier through a "show, don't tell" strategy. Rather than asking users to trust claims about simplicity and affordability, the landing page immediately demonstrates these values through its design, language, and user experience.

**The landing page employs a three-part approach:**

1. **Value-First Entry:** Users encounter free, accessible tools or assessments immediately upon arrival—a simple calculator, a needs assessment quiz, or a preview demo. This proves simplicity before asking for any commitment, email, or payment.

2. **Self-Directed Journey Paths:** The hero section presents two clear, non-intimidating paths—"Intip Yuk" (peek at business solutions) and "Mulai Dulu" (start learning)—allowing users to self-select without sales pressure. The casual, Indonesian-language CTAs reduce anxiety.

3. **Smart, Adaptive Experience:** A smart floating CTA button adapts based on user behavior (scrolling past business vs. student content), personalizing the experience without explicit data collection or invasive tracking.

### Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions

**1. Indonesian-First, Culturally Native**

- Not translated content, but culturally adapted messaging ("Hidup makin mudah dengan Makin Mudah" wordplay, "Intip Yuk" casual tone)
- Addresses specifically Indonesian pain points (MSME digitization, local job market for students)
- Pricing in Rupiah with local context (Rp 5-20 million bootcamp comparison)

**2. Trust Through Transparency**

- "Bayar Seperlumu, Bayar Semaumu" pricing messaging addresses contract fear directly
- Comprehensive FAQ section (7 questions) removes objections before they arise
- No hidden complexity—what you see is what you get

**3. Unified Dual-Audience Design**

- Serves both businesses and students without building separate sites
- Acknowledges both audiences have shared needs (simplicity, affordability, support)
- Creates community feel—businesses and students learning together

**4. Technology as Enabler, Not Barrier**

- Web-based (no installation) removes IT dependency
- Nuxt-based SEO optimization ensures discoverability
- Mobile-first responsive design meets users where they are
- Performance-optimized for Indonesian internet speeds

**5. Proof Before Commitment**

- Visual demos (GIFs of UI simplicity, payment flexibility visuals) make abstract concrete
- Free entry tools demonstrate value immediately
- Netflix-style catalogue cards (post-CTA) let users browse without pressure

### Why This Solution Will Succeed Where Others Haven't

**Empathy-Driven Design:**
Previous solutions failed because they were built by technical people for technical people. The Makin Mudah landing page is designed through the lens of our persona research—we've walked in the shoes of the intimidated business owner and the overwhelmed student.

**Cultural Alignment:**
International SaaS companies localize language but not culture. Indonesian users respond to different persuasion patterns, humor, and trust-building mechanisms. "Intip Yuk" works because it feels like a friend inviting you to explore, not a corporation demanding commitment.

**Removing Friction at Every Step:**
Every design decision—from the smart floating CTA to the accordion FAQ to the casual language—is optimized to remove one more excuse not to engage. Where competitors add gates (email capture, sales calls, trials), we remove them.

**Dual-Sided Network Effects:**
By serving both businesses (demand for IT solutions) and students (supply of IT talent), Makin Mudah creates a sustainable ecosystem. Students trained on Makin Mudah tools become advocates; businesses using Makin Mudah products hire Makin Mudah-trained students.

### High-Level Vision for the Product

**Immediate Vision (Landing Page Launch):**
A single-page marketing site that converts visitors into catalogue explorers and potential customers. The page establishes brand identity, proves core value proposition, and drives traffic to application/mentoring catalogues.

**Near-Term Vision (3-6 months):**
The landing page evolves with social proof (testimonials, success stories), interactive elements (calculators, assessments), and dynamic content based on user behavior patterns identified through analytics.

**Long-Term Vision (1-2 years):**
The landing page becomes the gateway to a full Makin Mudah ecosystem—applications, mentoring platform, community forums, content library. It adapts in real-time to each visitor, showing personalized content, offers, and pathways based on their profile and journey stage.

The ultimate success is when "Makin Mudah" becomes synonymous with "accessible IT" in Indonesia—the first place anyone thinks of when they need simple, affordable technology solutions or want to learn IT skills.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **Hero Section with Dual CTAs:** Animated headline "Hidup makin mudah dengan Makin Mudah" (responsive sizing, typing animation, emphasized brand words) + side-by-side CTA buttons [Intip Yuk] [Mulai Dulu] that clearly differentiate business vs student paths
  - **Rationale:** First impression is critical; dual CTAs enable self-selection immediately while animated headline creates engaging, modern feel

- **Value Propositions Section (3-Column Visual):** Three icons (price tag, browser, hands helping) with messaging for pricing flexibility ("Bayar Seperlumu, Bayar Semaumu"), no installation ("Tanpa Instalasi, Buka Dimana Saja"), and mentorship ("Didampingi Mentor")
  - **Rationale:** Addresses top 3 pain points (cost fear, complexity, isolation) with scannable visual format for mobile users

- **Problem → Solution Section with Visual Demos:** Two unified problems ("IT terlalu ribet dan bikin pusing?" / "Takut terjebak biaya mahal?") with corresponding solutions, enhanced with short GIF showing ease of use and visual of flexible payment options. Stacked layout with CTA [Intip Solusinya]
  - **Rationale:** "Show, don't tell" proves claims; visual demos build credibility for non-technical users who don't trust text alone

- **FAQ Section (Accordion):** 7 essential questions covering pricing, technical requirements, getting started, support availability, value delivered, commitment length, and trial options. Accordion format to keep page clean
  - **Rationale:** Removes final objections before conversion; accordion UX balances comprehensiveness with page length

- **Final CTA Section:** Closing headline "Siap untuk hidup yang makin mudah?" with single CTA [Intip Solusinya] leading to catalogue pages
  - **Rationale:** Reinforces brand messaging, gives users who scrolled through entire page final conversion opportunity

- **Footer:** Simple copyright notice for MVP
  - **Rationale:** Legal requirement; keep minimal to maintain focus on conversion elements

- **Nuxt SEO Optimization:** Meta tags, structured data (FAQ schema for rich snippets), sitemap, proper heading hierarchy, Open Graph tags for social sharing
  - **Rationale:** Organic search is primary traffic driver (60% target); SEO foundation must be in MVP, difficult to retrofit later

- **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layouts optimized for mobile devices (70%+ expected traffic), <3 second load time on 3G connections
  - **Rationale:** Indonesian users are mobile-first; desktop-first approach would exclude majority of target audience

- **Analytics Integration:** Google Analytics 4 with event tracking for CTA clicks, scroll depth, FAQ interactions, and path selection (business vs student)
  - **Rationale:** Cannot optimize what we don't measure; analytics foundation needed from day 1 to validate assumptions

- **Catalogue Pages (Basic):** Two Netflix-style card layout pages (applications, mentoring services) that CTAs link to, showing product/service options even if not yet available
  - **Rationale:** CTAs need destination; "coming soon" cards validate interest without requiring full product builds

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Smart floating CTA button (adaptive based on scroll position)
- Multi-purpose floating button with announcements/promotions
- Free tools/assessments/calculators on landing page
- Interactive quizzes or need assessment flows

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- **Target Platforms:** Web-based only (desktop and mobile browsers), no native mobile apps for MVP
- **Browser/OS Support:**
  - **Mobile:** Chrome Android 90+, Safari iOS 13+, Samsung Internet 14+ (covers 95%+ Indonesian mobile users)
  - **Desktop:** Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
  - **No support for:** IE11, legacy mobile browsers
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - **Load Time:** <3 seconds on 3G connections (Indonesian average mobile speed)
  - **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** <1.5 seconds
  - **Lighthouse Score:** 90+ performance, 100 accessibility, 100 SEO, 90+ best practices
  - **Core Web Vitals:** LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1
  - **Bundle Size:** Initial JS bundle <200KB gzipped, CSS <50KB gzipped

### Technology Preferences

- **Frontend:**
  - **Nuxt 3** (Vue 3 framework with SSR/SSG capabilities for SEO)
  - **Rationale:** Best-in-class Vue metaframework, excellent SEO support out-of-the-box, good Indonesian developer community
  - **Rendering:** Static Site Generation (SSG) for landing page (pre-rendered at build time for maximum performance), with option to add SSR for dynamic catalogue pages later
  - **UI Components:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, HeadlessUI or Radix Vue for accessible components (accordion, modals)
  - **Animation:** GSAP or Framer Motion Vue for hero typing animation, GreenSock for smooth scroll-triggered effects

- **Backend:**
  - **MVP:** Serverless functions (Netlify/Vercel Functions or Firebase Functions) for simple form handling, analytics events
  - **Rationale:** Minimal backend needs for MVP; serverless reduces infrastructure overhead
  - **Future:** Node.js/Express or Nest.js when catalogue needs backend (user accounts, product management, mentor booking)

- **Database:**
  - **MVP:** None required (static content, no user data persistence)
  - **Future:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB for user data, product catalogue, mentor profiles
  - **Rationale:** PostgreSQL for relational data (products, users, bookings), MongoDB if need flexible schemas for different product types

- **Hosting/Infrastructure:**
  - **Primary Choice:** Vercel or Netlify (excellent Nuxt support, global CDN, generous free tier, automatic deploys from Git)
  - **Rationale:** Indonesian edge locations via CDN, simple deployment, SSL included, preview deployments for testing
  - **Alternative:** AWS Amplify or Google Firebase Hosting (if planning broader AWS/GCP ecosystem integration)
  - **CDN Considerations:** Ensure CDN has Jakarta/Singapore PoPs for low latency to Indonesian users

### Architecture Considerations

- **Repository Structure:**
  - **Mono-repo approach:** Single repo for landing page + catalogue pages initially (simple, fewer moving parts)
  - **Future:** Migrate to monorepo tool (Turborepo, Nx) when adding backend services, admin dashboard, etc.
  - **Folder Structure:**
    ```
    /pages (Nuxt pages - landing, catalogue-apps, catalogue-mentoring)
    /components (reusable Vue components - Hero, ValueProps, FAQ, etc.)
    /assets (images, icons, GIFs)
    /composables (Vue composables for analytics, scroll tracking, CTA logic)
    /public (static files, sitemap, robots.txt)
    ```

- **Service Architecture:**
  - **MVP:** Static site with client-side analytics and event tracking
  - **Phase 2:** Add edge functions for smart CTA logic, A/B testing assignments, personalization
  - **Year 1:** Microservices or serverless architecture connecting landing page to product apps, mentoring platform, community, content CMS

- **Integration Requirements:**
  - **Analytics:** Google Analytics 4 (event tracking), Google Tag Manager (flexibility to add more tools)
  - **SEO:** Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools
  - **Performance Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics or Lighthouse CI in CI/CD pipeline
  - **Error Tracking:** Sentry or LogRocket for client-side error monitoring
  - **Future Integrations:** CRM (for lead management), email marketing (Mailchimp/SendGrid), payment gateway (Midtrans for Indonesia), WhatsApp Business API

- **Security/Compliance:**
  - **HTTPS:** Required (enforced by hosting platform)
  - **Data Privacy:** Comply with Indonesian PDP law (Perlindungan Data Pribadi) - privacy policy, cookie consent if using tracking cookies
  - **Analytics Consent:** Consider cookie banner for GDPR-style consent (future-proofing)
  - **XSS Protection:** Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, sanitize any user inputs in future forms
  - **DDoS Protection:** Provided by Vercel/Netlify infrastructure
  - **Secrets Management:** Environment variables for API keys, never commit to repo

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** Bootstrap/self-funded project - minimize external costs
  - **Hosting:** Must use free tier (Vercel/Netlify Free covers MVP needs)
  - **Tools:** Prefer open-source or free tiers (Google Analytics, free design tools)
  - **No paid marketing budget for MVP** - rely on organic SEO, social media, word-of-mouth
  - **Asset creation:** DIY or low-cost options (Canva, free stock photos, self-created GIFs)

- **Timeline:** Launch MVP within 4-6 weeks from project brief approval
  - **Week 1:** Design and content creation (wireframes, copy, visual assets)
  - **Week 2-3:** Development (Nuxt setup, component implementation, SEO configuration)
  - **Week 4:** Testing, refinement, analytics setup
  - **Week 5-6:** Buffer for unforeseen issues, final polish, launch prep
  - **Risk:** Timeline assumes no major blockers; delays in content/design push development back

- **Resources:** Solo developer or small team (1-2 developers max)
  - **Skills needed:** Nuxt/Vue proficiency, Tailwind CSS, basic animation, SEO knowledge
  - **Design:** Not a dedicated designer - rely on Tailwind components, design templates, or simple custom design
  - **Content:** Business owner/founder writes copy (with potential editing support)
  - **No dedicated QA:** Developer performs testing, recruit friends/family for user testing

- **Technical:** Existing infrastructure limitations
  - **Domain:** Assume makinmudah.com domain already owned or will be purchased (<$15/year)
  - **No existing backend:** Starting from scratch, cannot leverage existing systems
  - **Performance constraints:** Limited to what Vercel/Netlify free tier provides (bandwidth, build minutes)
  - **No existing customer data:** Cannot pre-fill testimonials, stats, or social proof (must use placeholders or skip for MVP)

### Key Assumptions

- **Market Assumptions:**
  - Indonesian small businesses and students actively search for IT solutions and learning opportunities online
  - Google search is primary discovery method (60% of traffic will be organic)
  - English proficiency is low enough that Indonesian-first approach is significant differentiator
  - Target users have reliable enough internet to load a 3-second page (not offline-first need)

- **User Behavior Assumptions:**
  - Users will self-select correctly between business and student paths without confusion
  - Dual CTAs don't create decision paralysis (provide clarity, not overwhelm)
  - Visual demos (GIFs, graphics) are sufficient proof - don't need live interactive demos for MVP
  - Users trust "coming soon" catalogue pages and won't abandon due to lack of available products

- **Product Assumptions:**
  - Makin Mudah will have actual applications and mentoring services to deliver within 3-6 months of landing page launch
  - Products will live up to "simple" and "affordable" promises made on landing page
  - Pricing model ("Bayar Seperlumu, Bayar Semaumu") can be operationalized (not just marketing speak)
  - Quality of applications/mentoring will justify word-of-mouth growth

- **Technical Assumptions:**
  - Nuxt 3 is stable enough for production use (no major breaking changes)
  - Vercel/Netlify infrastructure reliably serves Indonesian users with acceptable latency
  - Google Analytics data will be sufficient for optimization decisions (no need for premium analytics tools)
  - Static site generation adequately serves SEO needs (SSR not required for ranking)

- **Business Model Assumptions:**
  - Conversion funnel: landing page → catalogue → lead capture → sales follow-up is viable
  - Email or contact form leads can be nurtured to paying customers without automated funnel
  - 15% landing-to-catalogue conversion rate translates to meaningful business pipeline
  - Organic SEO traffic provides sufficient volume (paid ads not required for viability testing)

- **Competitive Assumptions:**
  - No major Indonesian competitor will launch similar "accessible IT" positioning during MVP development
  - International SaaS companies won't significantly improve Indonesian localization in near term
  - First-mover advantage exists and matters in this market segment

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Market Risk - Insufficient organic traffic:** SEO takes 3-6 months to gain traction. Landing page may not achieve 1,000+ visitors in first 30 days without paid marketing.
  - **Impact:** Cannot validate messaging, conversion rates, or dual-audience model
  - **Mitigation:** Supplement with social media marketing, founder's network, targeted outreach to business communities and student groups

- **Product Risk - "Coming soon" abandonment:** Users click CTAs expecting products, find "coming soon" catalogue, and never return.
  - **Impact:** Low conversion, damaged brand trust, wasted traffic
  - **Mitigation:** Set clear expectations ("Launching Q2 2026"), offer email waitlist with exclusive early access incentive, provide alternative value (free guides/tools)

- **Technical Risk - Performance on actual Indonesian networks:** Testing on fast connections may not reflect real 3G experience.
  - **Impact:** High bounce rates, poor user experience, failed performance targets
  - **Mitigation:** Test using Chrome DevTools network throttling, recruit Indonesian users for real-device testing, monitor real user metrics (RUM) post-launch

- **Messaging Risk - Dual-audience confusion:** Users don't understand difference between business and student paths, click wrong CTA, or freeze from decision paralysis.
  - **Impact:** Poor user experience, incorrect self-selection, reduced conversion
  - **Mitigation:** User testing with 5-10 people from each segment, clear visual differentiation, add explanatory subtext under CTAs if needed

### Open Questions

- What specific applications will be in the catalogue at launch? (Impacts visual demos, FAQ answers, messaging specificity)
- How will mentoring services work? (1-on-1 sessions? Group classes? Async support? Pricing structure?)
- What is the actual pricing model for "Bayar Seperlumu, Bayar Semaumu"? (Monthly subscription? Per-feature? Credits system?)
- Who is responsible for creating visual assets (GIFs, icons, graphics)? (Designer? Developer? Outsource?)
- What content will FAQ answers contain? (Need to write 7 detailed answers for accordion)
- How will leads from catalogue pages be captured and followed up? (Email form? CRM integration? Manual process?)
- What SEO keywords are we targeting beyond the obvious? (Need keyword research for content optimization)
- Is there existing brand identity (logo, colors, fonts)? (Impacts design decisions)

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Competitive landscape analysis (Who are the actual competitors in Indonesian market? How do they position?)
- Keyword research for Indonesian IT solution searches (Validate SEO traffic assumptions)
- Pricing benchmarking (What do similar services cost in Indonesia? What's "affordable"?)
- User testing of messaging (Does "Hidup makin mudah dengan Makin Mudah" resonate? Is it cheesy or clever?)
- Technical feasibility of smart floating CTA (How complex is scroll tracking + adaptation logic?)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Approve project brief** - Review this document, provide feedback, finalize scope and approach
2. **Define product offerings** - Create list of initial applications and mentoring services for catalogue pages
3. **Establish pricing model** - Determine how "Bayar Seperlumu, Bayar Semaumu" translates to actual pricing
4. **Write FAQ answers** - Draft responses to 7 questions identified in MVP scope
5. **Create/gather visual assets** - Source icons, create GIF mockups, gather placeholder images
6. **Set up development environment** - Initialize Nuxt project, configure hosting, set up Git repository
7. **Begin content writing** - Draft copy for all landing page sections based on brainstorming session

### PM Handoff

This Project Brief provides the full context for **Makin Mudah Landing Page**. The Product Manager should review the brief thoroughly, working with stakeholders to:

- Validate assumptions and identify any that need immediate testing
- Clarify open questions (especially product catalogue and pricing model)
- Create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) that specifies exact functionality, user flows, and acceptance criteria
- Work with development team to refine technical approach and timeline
- Establish success metrics tracking and reporting cadence

The brief is ready for PRD generation when open questions are resolved and immediate actions (items 2-5) are completed.
