nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Query parameter encoding with encodeURIComponent prevents XSS. No user input handling. Static content only.'
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Lightweight components (~2KB bundle), but no automated tests to verify <3s load time or LCP <2.5s per AC12. Manual verification recommended.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: '100% test pass rate (162/162). Hash navigation relies on client-side JS with 100ms delay for smooth scroll. No error handling for scroll behavior edge cases.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean component structure, reusable CatalogueCard and CatalogueGrid, well-commented sections, strong TypeScript typing. Follows Vue 3 Composition API best practices.'
