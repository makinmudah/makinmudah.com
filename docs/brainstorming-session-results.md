## Technique Sessions

### 1. Role Playing - 30 minutes

**Description:** Explored user perspectives by embodying two key personas to understand their needs, fears, and decision-making criteria.

#### Ideas Generated:

**Persona 1: Small Business Owner (Zero IT Knowledge)**

1. Core need: Easy to use, no installation, accessible anywhere (web-based/SaaS)
2. Primary fear: Getting locked into expensive contracts
3. Value messaging: Affordable solutions, simple for non-experts
4. Hero headline: "Hidup makin mudah dengan Makin Mudah"
5. Pricing message: "Bayar Seperlumu, Bayar Semaumu"
6. CTA language: "Intip Yuk" (casual, friendly, exploratory tone)
7. Trust requirement: Proof that solutions are actually simple

**Persona 2: Student (Learning IT Skills)**

8. Core need: Easy learning approach with step-by-step tutorials and hands-on projects
9. Critical requirement: Mentor supervision and guidance
10. Support system: Media platform to share difficulties and get help
11. Primary fear: Too expensive for student budget
12. Messaging: "You'll never learn alone" (or Indonesian: "Belajar Bareng, Bukan Sendirian")
13. CTA language: "Mulai dulu" (encouraging, low-pressure)
14. Proof needed: Evidence of affordable mentoring and community support

#### Insights Discovered:

- Two distinct user journeys require different messaging and CTAs
- Both personas share fear of high costs but for different reasons (contracts vs budget)
- Trust-building is critical but manifests differently (simplicity proof vs mentorship availability)
- Language tone must be conversational and non-technical for both audiences

#### Notable Connections:

- Both personas need "accessible anywhere" solutions (alignment opportunity)
- Unified messaging around affordability addresses both audiences' fears
- Mentorship differentiates Makin Mudah from typical SaaS competitors

### 2. Journey Mapping - 45 minutes

**Description:** Mapped the complete user scroll-through experience, designing each landing page section with purpose and flow.

#### Ideas Generated:

**Section 1: Hero**

1. Main headline: "Hidup makin mudah dengan Makin Mudah"
2. Dual CTAs side-by-side: [Intip Yuk] [Mulai Dulu]
3. Clear differentiation between business and student paths from the start

**Section 2: Value Propositions (Visual, 3 Columns)** 4. Icon 1: Price tag → "Bayar Seperlumu, Bayar Semaumu" 5. Icon 2: Browser → "Tanpa Instalasi, Buka Dimana Saja" 6. Icon 3: Hands helping → "Didampingi Mentor" 7. Visual presentation for quick scanning and comprehension

**Section 3: Problem → Solution (Unified)** 8. Problem 1: "IT terlalu ribet dan bikin pusing?" 9. Solution 1: "Solusi kami dibuat sederhana, bahkan untuk yang gaptek sekalipun" 10. Problem 2: "Takut terjebak biaya mahal?" 11. Solution 2: "Bayar Seperlumu, Bayar Semaumu" (reinforcement) 12. CTA: [Intip Solusinya] 13. Purpose: Address universal pain points before diving into specifics

**Section 4: FAQ (Accordion Style)** 14. FAQ 1: "Berapa sih biayanya?" 15. FAQ 2: "Butuh komputer khusus gak?" 16. FAQ 3: "Gimana cara mulainya?" 17. FAQ 4: "Kalau ada masalah, bisa tanya siapa?" 18. FAQ 5: "Apa aja yang didapat?" 19. FAQ 6: "Harus komitmen berapa lama?" 20. FAQ 7: "Bisa coba dulu gak?" 21. Accordion format to keep page clean while providing comprehensive information

**Section 5: Final CTA + Footer** 22. Closing headline: "Siap untuk hidup yang makin mudah?" 23. Single unified CTA: [Intip Solusinya] 24. Footer: Copyright (simple for initial launch)

#### Insights Discovered:

- Clear progression from attention → value → problem/solution → objections → conversion
- Unified problem/solution section creates broader appeal than separate sections
- FAQ placement before final CTA removes hesitation at critical moment
- Consistent "Intip" language family maintains brand voice

#### Notable Connections:

- Hero dual CTAs segment audiences early, but middle sections unify them
- Value props address both personas' needs simultaneously
- Final single CTA brings audiences back together after understanding benefits

### 3. SCAMPER Method - 35 minutes

**Description:** Systematically enhanced landing page elements using creative thinking prompts (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse/Rearrange).

#### Ideas Generated:

**S - Substitute:** 25. Smart floating CTA button (bottom-right corner, always visible) 26. Default state: [Intip Solusinya] 27. Adapts to [Intip Yuk] when scrolling past business content 28. Adapts to [Mulai Dulu] when scrolling past student/mentoring content 29. Replaces multiple static CTAs with one intelligent element

**C - Combine:** 30. Enhanced Section 3: Problem/Solution + Visual demos 31. Problem 1 + Short GIF showing ease of use 32. Problem 2 + Visual of flexible payment options 33. Stacked layout: Problem → Solution text → Demo visual 34. Makes solutions tangible with proof, not just claims

**A - Adapt:** 35. Netflix-style plan cards on catalogue page (post-CTA destination) 36. Section 1: Business Applications cards 37. Section 2: Mentoring Services cards 38. Card content: Title, key features, pricing, CTA to learn more

**M - Modify:** 39. Hero headline with responsive sizing (adapts to screen size) 40. Emphasized words: "MAKIN MUDAH" brand name stands out 41. Typing animation effect on page load for dynamic first impression

**P - Put to Another Use:** 42. Multi-purpose floating button: CTA + announcements 43. Badge/notification dot when announcement available 44. Dynamic announcements: "Aplikasi Baru Tersedia" (business) or "Mentor Slot Terbuka" (students) 45. Click/hover badge to see announcement details

**E - Eliminate:** 46. Decision: No elimination needed - all elements serve purpose

**R - Reverse/Rearrange:** 47. Decision: Keep current value props order (Pricing → No Installation → Mentorship)

#### Insights Discovered:

- Technology can make UX more personalized without overwhelming users
- Visual proof (GIFs, payment visuals) significantly strengthens messaging
- Familiar patterns (Netflix cards) reduce cognitive load
- Small animations add polish without sacrificing simplicity

#### Notable Connections:

### Insights & Learnings

- **Dual-audience doesn't mean dual landing pages:** Unified messaging in middle sections creates efficiency while strategic CTAs provide personalization

- **Indonesian cultural tone matters:** Casual, friendly language ("Intip Yuk", "Mulai dulu") reduces intimidation and builds approachability - this isn't just translation, it's cultural adaptation

- **Fear-driven decision making:** Both personas' primary blocker is fear (expensive contracts, can't afford it) - addressing fear directly is more important than feature listing

- **Progressive disclosure works:** Hero gives choice, middle unifies with value, FAQ addresses doubts, final CTA converts - respects user's journey rather than forcing early commitment

- **Visual proof > text claims:** Combining solutions with demos (GIFs, payment visuals) significantly strengthens credibility for non-technical audiences

- **Smart UX requires simple foundations first:** Build static, clear landing page before adding adaptive elements like smart floating CTAs

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Complete Static Landing Page (Sections 1-5)

**Rationale:** Foundation for all other enhancements; provides immediate marketing presence; validates messaging with real users before investing in advanced features

**Next steps:**

1. Create Nuxt project with SEO optimization setup (vue-meta, sitemap, structured data)
2. Design and implement 5 sections with responsive layouts
3. Write and refine Indonesian copy for all sections
4. Source/design icons and imagery (price tag, browser, hands helping)
5. Implement accordion FAQ component
6. Test on mobile and desktop
7. Deploy to production

**Resources needed:**

- Nuxt developer (familiar with SEO best practices)
- Indonesian copywriter
- UI/UX designer for visual elements
- QA for cross-browser/device testing

**Timeline:** Build foundation before adding smart features

#### #2 Priority: Visual Value Proposition Section

**Rationale:** High impact for credibility; differentiates from competitors who only use text; relatively simple to implement alongside core landing page

**Next steps:**

1. Design custom icons or select high-quality icon set
2. Create three-column responsive grid layout
3. Implement hover effects or subtle animations for engagement
4. Write supporting copy for each value prop
5. Ensure accessibility (alt text, keyboard navigation)

**Resources needed:**

- Icon designer or quality icon library (e.g., Heroicons, custom illustration)
- CSS/animation developer
- Accessibility audit

**Timeline:** Integrate with priority #1 during initial build

**Next steps:**

1. Write comprehensive answers to 7 FAQ questions
2. Implement accessible accordion component (ARIA labels, keyboard support)
3. Add structured data markup for FAQ rich snippets (schema.org)
4. Consider tracking which FAQs are opened most frequently
5. Plan quarterly review of FAQ based on actual customer questions

**Resources needed:**

- Content writer with product knowledge
- Frontend developer for accordion component
- SEO specialist for structured data implementation

**Timeline:** Include in initial launch; iterate based on user feedback

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well

- **Persona-first approach** - Starting with role playing created empathy and informed all subsequent decisions
- **Journey mapping provided clarity** - Walking through the scroll experience section-by-section prevented abstract discussions
- **SCAMPER unlocked creativity** - Systematic prompts generated ideas we wouldn't have reached through freeform brainstorming
- **Indonesian language focus** - Keeping cultural context front-and-center ensured authentic, not translated, messaging
- **Balancing ambition with pragmatism** - Identified both immediate implementations and future innovations

### Areas for Further Exploration

- **Pricing model details:** How exactly does "Bayar Seperlumu, Bayar Semaumu" work? Subscription tiers? Pay-per-use? Need pricing strategy session
- **Catalogue page structure:** Netflix-style cards identified, but need to brainstorm specific applications and mentoring service offerings
- **SEO content strategy:** Beyond technical SEO, what blog/content will drive organic traffic? Keyword research needed
- **Student onboarding flow:** After "Mulai dulu" CTA, what's the experience? Mentorship matching process needs design
- **Business application showcase:** What apps are "coming soon"? Need product roadmap clarity to inform landing page promises
- **Conversion tracking:** What metrics define success? Need analytics strategy for testing and iteration

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

- **Morphological Analysis:** For pricing model design - list all parameters (billing frequency, feature tiers, user limits) and explore combinations
- **Assumption Reversal:** Challenge assumption that single landing page serves both audiences - what if separate pages performed better?
- **Question Storming:** Generate 50+ questions about the Makin Mudah offering to uncover gaps in product definition
- **Five Whys:** Dig deeper into "why mentorship?" to clarify unique value proposition vs competitors

### Questions That Emerged

- What happens after a user clicks "Intip Yuk" vs "Mulai dulu"? What are the distinct experiences?
- How do we prove "simple even for non-experts" before users sign up? Demo videos? Interactive preview?
- What's the mentor vetting/matching process? How does that get communicated on the landing page?
- Should there be a "coming soon" indicator for applications under development?
- What's the minimum viable catalogue (apps + services) needed before launching the landing page?
- How does pricing actually work? Is it per-application? Per-user? Monthly subscription?
- What competitors exist in Indonesian market? How do we differentiate in messaging?
- Should there be language toggle (Indonesian/English) or Indonesian-only?

### Next Session Planning

**Suggested topics:**

1. **Pricing Strategy Workshop** - Define "Bayar Seperlumu, Bayar Semaumu" concretely
2. **Catalogue Structure Brainstorm** - Design the applications and services pages users land on after CTAs
3. **Content Strategy Session** - Plan SEO-driven content (blog, guides, tutorials) to support landing page
4. **Mentorship UX Flow** - Map out student journey from "Mulai dulu" through mentor matching to first session

**Recommended timeframe:** Within 1-2 weeks (while landing page implementation begins)

**Preparation needed:**

- Gather competitive research on Indonesian IT services/education landing pages
- Draft initial pricing model options to discuss
- List all planned applications and mentoring services (even if incomplete)
- Review Nuxt SEO best practices documentation
